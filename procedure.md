Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the **Start** button to start the experiment.
2. The water shall start flowing through the flow channel.
3. Eventually the water will reach the nozel and come out as a long straing line of water flow.
4. The water that came out will hit the buckets of the turbines and force the turbine to rotate anti-clockwise.
5. Try to change the flow speed by using **Control flow speed** glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!
6. Changing the speed of water flow will obviously affect the rotating speed of Turbine as well. Try to work out the relationship between the two.
7. The **Control flow speed** glider is dynamic and can be changed midway when the turbine is rotating too. 
8. Click/Tap on the **Reset** button to restart the expeirment afresh, i.e., with empty apparatus.
